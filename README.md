## üì¶ Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sasi2400/ssrn-summarizer-extension.git
   cd ssrn-summarizer-extension
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the extension directory

3. **Set up the backend:**

   - See the [Backend Repository](https://github.com/sasi2400/ssrn-summarizer-backend) for setup instructions
   - Or use the public cloud deployment (instructions below)

### Backend Setup

The extension requires a backend service for AI analysis. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Public Cloud Deployment
- The extension will automatically detect and connect to the public cloud backend
- No setup required - just install the extension

#### Option 2: Run Local Backend
1. Clone the backend repository (private):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:sasi2400/ssrn-summarizer-backend.git
   cd ssrn-summarizer-backend
   ```
2. Follow the setup instructions in the backend README
3. The extension will automatically detect your local backend

    localBackendUrl: 'http://localhost:5000',
    cloudBackendUrl: 'https://your-cloud-deployment.com',
    localTimeout: 60000,  // 60 seconds
    cloudTimeout: 120000  // 120 seconds
};
```
