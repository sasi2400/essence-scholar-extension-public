// app-bridge.js — the ONE script that runs on the Essence Scholar web app.
//
// Declared in the manifest against the app's own origins (content.js is injected
// programmatically on paper pages and never runs here, which is where the first
// version of this bridge was mistakenly put). It is deliberately tiny: a marker
// the app can read synchronously, and two messages.
// =============================================================================
// App handshake — the web app asks for a paper, this hands it to the capture
// =============================================================================
//
// SSRN sits behind Cloudflare, so the SERVER cannot fetch most papers: measured
// 2026-09-05 on four SSRN hits, three failed outright after ~60-80s and the one
// that "succeeded" imported the 2-page cover sheet as if it were the paper. The
// person's own browser has no such problem — they are logged in and clicking
// Download like anyone else — and this extension already captures that download.
//
// What was missing is the join: the app had no way to know the extension is
// here, and the capture had no way to know that THIS download is the one the
// reader just asked for. Two messages over `window.postMessage`, on the app's
// own pages only:
//
//   app  → extension   { type: 'arm-capture', ssrn_id, title }
//   extension → app    { type: 'armed' | 'extension-here', version }
//
// and the marker attribute below, which the app reads synchronously to tell
// "install the extension" from "it is installed and waiting".
//
// CONSENT: arming does NOT widen what is captured. The whitelist still decides
// (capture-sources.js), and an armed record only says "this reader already
// pressed Download & import for THIS paper in the app, so do not ask a second
// time". It matches one paper, expires, and is used once.
